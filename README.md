## Overview <a name='overview'></a>
The purpose of doing this project is to create a fully undetectable payload that is able to bypass all the Antivirus solutions installed on a system or perhaps the systems own malware defense like windows defender in windows Operating System. With the help of this payload, it would be easy to reside in a system fully undetected even after the system is fully secured with the various Anti-Malware Programs and the defense strategies. The target OS would be Windows as itâ€™s the most widely used Operating System in the Present scenario. Our project aims to make the payload to stay persistent even on a Patched system.
